h1(gemheader). wukong %(small):: hadoop made easy%

p(description). {{ site.description }}

Treat your dataset like a
* stream of lines when it's efficient to process by lines
* stream of field arrays when it's efficient to deal directly with fields
* stream of lightweight objects when it's efficient to deal with objects

Wukong is friends with "Hadoop":http://hadoop.apache.org/core the elephant, "Pig":http://hadoop.apache.org/pig/ the query language, and the @cat@ on your command line. 

Send Wukong questions to the "Infinite Monkeywrench mailing list":http://groups.google.com/group/infochimps-code
