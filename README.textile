Wukong makes using Hadoop so easy a chimpanzee can use it.

h2. How to write a Wukong script

  #!/usr/bin/env ruby
  require 'wukong'

  module WordCount
    class Mapper < Wukong::Streamer::LineStreamer
      # Emit each word in each line.
      def process line
  	yield line.strip.split(/\W+/).
      end
    end

    class Reducer < Wukong::Streamer::UniqCountLinesReducer
    end
  end
  # Execute the script
  Script.new(WordCount::Mapper, WordCount::Reducer).run


h2. How to run a Wukong script

  your/script.rb --go path/to/input_files path/to/output_dir

All of the file paths are HDFS paths except your script path, of course, which
is on the local filesystem.

You can supply arbitrary command line arguments (they wind up as key-value pairs
in the options path your mapper and reducer receive), and you can use the hadoop
syntax to specify more than one input file:

  ./path/to/your/script.rb --any_specific_options --options=can_have_vals \
    --go "input_dir/part_*,input_file2.tsv,etc.tsv" path/to/output_dir


h2. How to test your scripts

To run mapper on its own:

  cat ./local/test/input.tsv | ./examples/word_count.rb --map | more
  
or if your test data lies on the HDFS,

  hdp-cat test/input.tsv | ./examples/word_count.rb --map | more


h2. What's up with Wukong::AndPig?

@Wukong::AndPig@ is a small library to more easily generate code for the
"Pig":http://hadoop.apache.org/pig data analysis language.  See its
"README":wukong/and_pig/README.textile for more.

h2. Why is it called Wukong?

Hadoop, as you may know, is "named after a stuffed
elephant."http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadoop Wukong (the Monkey King), known
for his power and agility, is hero of a famous Chinese Fairytale in which he
journeys to the land of the Elephant:

Quoting "Sun Wukong's Wikipedia entry:":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wukong

bq. Sun Wukong (traditional Chinese: 孫悟空;
simplified Chinese: 孙悟空; pinyin: Sūn Wùkōng; Wade-Giles: Sun1 Wu4-k'ung1;
Japanese 孫悟空 (Son Gokū?)), known in the West as the Monkey King, is the main
character in the classical Chinese epic novel Journey to the West. In the novel,
he accompanies the monk Xuanzang on the journey to retrieve Buddhist sutras from
India.

bq. Sun Wukong possesses incredible strength, being able to lift his 13,500 jīn
(8,100 kg) Ruyi Jingu Bang with ease. He also has superb speed, traveling
108,000 li (54,000 kilometers) in one somersault. Sun knows 72 transformations,
which allows him to transform into various animals and objects; he is, however,
shown with slight problems transforming into other people, since he is unable to
complete the transformation of his tail. He is a skilled fighter, capable of
holding his own against the best generals of heaven. Each of his hairs possesses
magical properties, and is capable of transforming into a clone of the Monkey
King himself, or various weapons, animals, and other objects. He also knows
various spells in order to command wind, part water, conjure protective circles
against demons, freeze humans, demons, and gods alike. (Journey to the West, Wu
Cheng'en (1500-1582), Translated by Foreign Languages Press, Beijing 1993.)

p. Sounds about right to us :) The "BBC-produced Jaime Hewlett / Damon Albarn
short":http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympics/monkey made for the 2008
Olympics is highly recommended.
